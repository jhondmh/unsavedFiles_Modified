# Unsaved Files Indicator for VS Code

A lightweight extension for Visual Studio Code that indicates if you have unsaved files. This extension is a modification of the [YOU HAVE UNSAVED FILES](https://github.com/esamattis/vscode-unsaved) extension originally created by [esamattis](https://github.com/esamattis).

## Features

- Displays an indicator in the status bar if there are unsaved files.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically show an "UNSAVED" indicator in the status bar if there are unsaved files in your editor.

## Modifications

The main differences between this extension and the original "YOU HAVE UNSAVED FILES" are:

1. Removed the color change that was applied to the status bar in the original extension.
2. Added the ability to customize the color of the "UNSAVED" indicator.
3. Updated dependencies for greater compatibility and security.
